## Issue

When I tried `/Dropbox/think/development/js/YSlow_example/` everything worked well, but I tried to do the same here, and `npm install yslowjs --save` didn't work, so when I copied the module in `YSlow_example` and did `npm install --save yslowjs` at the same time, everything worked fine, so not sure if was the module copied or the `npm install` with the `--save` before `yslowjs` that worked.
